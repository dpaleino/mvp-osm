MVP OSM: a tool that allows to individuate the areas of high activity in
openstreetmap based on level of detail.

By observing the world map which is drawn on OpenStreetMap, it is
relatively easy to realize which areas are higher in community
activities and which are more marginal.

The high level of details certainly can be considered as a good
indicator of quality of OSM data in a zone.

OpenStreetMap's success in the world has meant that the contributions
the map are now so many that, at present, even without a GPS, anyone can
make a contribution (or through tracing activities, or by importing
data, or by adding destination information retrieved from other data
sources ...). The map becomes increasingly rich, but often the concept
of quality of data is questioned.

MVP OSM wants to highlight areas wherethe osmers dedicate attention to
detail, which is strongly required the use of a GPS or at least a deep
knowledge of the area and consequent desire to see it best represented.

The input is a file. osm, which is converted by python in a file
spatialite (the gis extension for sqlite) and then processed for create
clusters, which are then derive the activity of a single or multiple
users on the area by create vector gis and heatmaps.
